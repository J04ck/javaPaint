# javaPaint

Just a multi user paint program made in java. It,s a server /client structure. You start by running the server. The server accept connections the port 41579. You can connect serveral clients to the server at once. 
The client starts and ask user for username, ipaddress and port. 
I made this program as a school assigment.
